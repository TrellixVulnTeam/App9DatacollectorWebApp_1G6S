I am using a 360 controller through Xpadder playing the Steam version of the game.

First time I set off Duel, I just stared while the timer ran out. How am I supposed to discern what B1, B2, and B3 are in a moments notice? It's not impossible. I thought about writing down what buttons they are attached to and learning like that.

But fuck that. We're not supposed to do that. I want a normal button overlay. Like the old PS1 overlay. I'm well aware of where box, x, circle and triangle are located so that would be easiest.

Hell even a 360 layout would be nice.

Any ideas?This is a new line addded!
